## Inspiration

As a student passionate about competitive programming, I noticed that many of my peers often miss coding contests simply because they are unaware of them. With contests hosted across various platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef, keeping track of them can be overwhelming. To solve this problem, I created **Contest Calendar** â€” a centralized platform to help students and programmers stay updated, set reminders, and never miss an opportunity to compete and learn.

## Future Updates

Here are some exciting features planned for future updates to enhance the user experience:

- **User Progress Tracking**: Integrate user profiles from platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef to fetch their contest data and maintain a record of their progress over time.
- **Leaderboard**: Introduce a leaderboard where users can compare their rankings based on contest participation, performance, or accumulated points.
- **Custom Contest Feeds**: Allow users to personalize their feed by selecting specific platforms or types of contests they are interested in.
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Expand reminder options to include email and in-app notifications in addition to Telegram bot alerts.
- **Social Sharing**: Enable users to share upcoming contests and their progress with friends directly from the platform.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the application for easier access and on-the-go notifications.

These updates aim to make **Contest Calendar** a comprehensive tool for competitive programmers.

2. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

1. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. The optimized build will be in the `build` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing between pages.
- **React Icons**: Icon library for React.
- **Lucide React**: Additional icons.
- **React Toastify**: For toast notifications.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

## API Integration

The application interacts with a backend server hosted at [https://contestcalendarscraper.onrender.com](https://contestcalendarscraper.onrender.com). Key API endpoints include:

### Contests
- `GET /api/contests/getall`: Fetch all contests.
- `POST /api/contests/scrape`: Trigger scraping of contest data.

### Users
- `GET /api/users/getAll`: Retrieve all users (admin only).
- `PUT /api/users/edit/:id`: Edit user information.
- `DELETE /api/users/delete/:id`: Delete a user.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/signup`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/signin`: Log in an existing user.
- `PUT /api/auth/changepassword`: Change user password.

### Notifications
- `POST /api/notification/set/:id`: Set a contest reminder.

## Telegram Bot Integration

To receive contest reminders, users need to register with the Telegram bot **ContestCalenderBot**. After registration, users can set reminders within the app, and notifications will be sent via the bot.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `components/`: Reusable components like Header, Footer, and Notification.
  - `pages/`: Different pages like Home, Admin, Sign Up, and Sign In.
  - `api/`: Functions to interact with the backend API.
